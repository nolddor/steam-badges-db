        As of today SteamBadgesDB offers variety of beverages, such as latte macchiato or cappuccino. I'd appreciate if it offered some no-milk options as well, for example espresso or ristretto.
        I believe it'd further improve the program offering the users wider selection, which is very convenient.

        Simply add an option to brew some no-milk types of coffee. The existing logic is fine, we just need wider choice!

        I'm allergic to milk, there is currently no option to pick a beverage that doesn't include it.
        Temporarily I'm switching cup mid-brewing as a workaround, but that is suboptimal considering the milk wasted.
